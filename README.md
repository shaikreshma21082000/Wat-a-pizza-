Problem Statement - C6S4MC8 Wat-A-Pizza – Mastery Challenge 8
Wat-a-pizza started as a takeaway joint from a small city, in India about a year ago
and soon became very popular in its vicinity for its custom-made vegetarian pizzas.
Considering its popularity, the owner of Wat-a-pizza decided to offer home
delivery as an option to attract customers who were willing to pay an additional
delivery charge. The business of this joint has now grown exponentially.
Recently, the owner has started receiving complaints related to mix-up of orders
and incorrect billing. To address this problem, the owner wants to move from a
manual order intake and billing process to an automated one. She would like the
person in charge to be able to take orders and generate bills for all customers
automatically.
The owner has engaged you to build a system that helps manage the order intake
and billing process. Design the database to store customer and order details.
